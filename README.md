# Kim-Taeyeon-Discography-Page
This page is a simple image map where you will link an image or set of images and "mapped" to a text below the image. The image can be divided into shapes according to their coordinates or individual images but using the shape, coords attribute to create the link. The theme of this page is "collection of albums" or "Discography". The artist I used is Kim Taeyeon, a Korean pop artist. 

The albums in this page are clickable but instead of <a> tag, <area> coords Attribute were used. Once clicked, the page will direct you to the album's description enclosed in a table.
